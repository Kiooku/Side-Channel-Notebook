**Side-channel attacks *(SCA)*:**  An attack enabled by **leakage of information from a physical cryptosystem**. Characteristics that could be exploited in a side-channel attack include **timing, power consumption, and electromagnetic and acoustic emissions**. *[(Source)](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/side_channel_attack)*

## Types of Attacks on embedded system

> [!NOTE]

There are tons of types of attack on embedded systems, and here's a list of some of them:

- **Software Attacks on Hardware**
    - **Fault Injection:** Practice of pushing hardware to a point that induces processing errors.
        - *DRAM Hammering*
        - *CPU overclocking*
    - **Side-Channel Attacks**
        - **Microarchitectural attacks**
- **PCB-Level Attacks**
- **Logical Attacks:** Attack at the level of logical interfaces.
- **Debugging and Tracing**
- **Fuzzing Devices:** The goal is to find crashes to exploit for code injection.
    - **Dump fuzzing:** Send random data to a target and observe its behavior.
    - **Smart fuzzing:** Focuses on protocols, data structures, typical crash-causing values, or code structure.
    - **Generation-based fuzzing:** Fuzzing that creates inputs from scratch.
    - **Mutation-based fuzzing:** Fuzzing that takes existing inputs and modifies them.
    - **Coverage-guided fuzzing:** Fuzzing that takes existing data to allow you to find deeper bugs.
- **Flash Image Analysis**

## Side-Channel Attacks (SCA)

As for hardware attacks, there're a large number of possible side-channel attacks. Here is a non-exhaustive list of SCA categories [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack):
- **Cache attack**
- **Timing attack**
- **Power-monitoring attack**
- **Electromagnetic attack**
- **Acoustic cryptanalysis**
- **Differential fault analysis**
- **Data remanence**

## Difference between Side-channel attacks and  Invasive attacks

> [!NOTE]
> The information on this section are from [An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography (Second Edition)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-1711-2)

- **Black-box model:** The attacker only sees what goes in and out of the cipher.
- **Gray-box model:** The attacks has access to a cipher implementation.

Both of this attacks believe in the **gray-box model**.

However, SCA are noninvasive, whereas invasive attacks are.

Invasive attacks are more powerful than SCA, but more expensive because they require sophisitacted equipment. They require tools such as a high-resolution microscopes and a chemical lab.

# Attacks implementation and labs

> [!NOTE]
> I find it very difficult to find free resources to perform SCA safely, which make the learning process longer, as we need theory and practice to fully understand SCA. That's why I would like to provide some practical labs, but it's going to take some time.

> However, if I find practical labs for certain attacks, I'll link to those resources as well.
